Goal: copy from This PC > Documents > _t108 >Readme.md  ...to... GitHub: hello-world/Lab1/Readme.md


Created from scratch on 7/21/2019 on Lenovo laptop.  Want to overwrite same file name in GitHub by
uploading to the Master folder directly from the laptop.

This is a test to see if it's that simple - or do I need a GitHub environment on the laptop first...?
